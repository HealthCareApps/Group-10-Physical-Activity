# Group-10-Physical-Activity
Team members: Leanna, Felipe, Quintin, Arielle, and Vinnie. Topic: App for Physical Activity


The app will be a patient/health professional interface, to guide and log the patient at home physical therapy activities. On the server database would be a list of activities/exercises and patients, different activities will be assigned to each patient, and a log of each patient.

On the app side of things, the patient will see directions and videos for the exercise he/she needs to perform, a start and stop button will record when and for how long each exercise was performed and logged on the vista server.

The health worker can follow up when the patient comes for an office visit if the patient has been performing the prescribed exercises, and check on expected progress.

So our only sensor would be a time record of performed exercise.

The story board will be updated changing the term doctor to health professional.
